## Initial Setup
Explain every step you should do in order to get ready to start the development, what tools you need to install/configure. e.g. `create a repository` or `install gnu c compiler`.

## Code Requirements
Let's start with the tricky part... Now it's time to plan the coding part itself.
Get started by giving some general aspect for the code you're going to write. Code style, standards to follow, paradigm to use, development method and/or version of the language to use. e.g. `Test Driven Development of Object oriented ES2018 JavaScript code following the Google style`.

### Architecture
Write down a list of one sentence-defined functions to implement. e.g. `function to register a user` or `function to change the user's password`.

### Pseudo-code
Write in pseudo-code the simplest implementation of every function defined in the Architecture section above. If you need more than just a few lines of pseudo code, maybe means that function can be spliced down into two or more 'mini-functions'.

## Schedule
Create a schedule with deadlines to each item in the Architecture item, keep in mind to assign a fair time to each piece of work, too much is bad, but, not enough is worst.
